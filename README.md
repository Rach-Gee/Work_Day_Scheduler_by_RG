## Introduction

> By using my webpage you are able to plan your day down to the hour. Save, and return later to check in on how you have kept your schedule. Hours in the past will be greyed out, the current hour (local time) will be red and the read of your day will show green. 

> It is a great clean and clear way to keep track of your day.
